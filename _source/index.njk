{% set introduction %}
Good ideas transform businesses. Yet, many regard creativity as the preserve of artists and designers. I believe that anyone is capable of exceptional ideas â€” regardless of who they are or what they do.

I help people unleash their creative potential. But I don't rely on unlikely "eureka" moments. Instead,  I teach a systematic approach to creative thinking. Great ideas are simply an inevitable outcome of the process.
