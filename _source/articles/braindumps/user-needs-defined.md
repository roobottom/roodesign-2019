title: What are user needs?

Earlier, I overheard a rather a college on a remote meeting. She's a user researcher, and was emphatically defending a report they'd written for stockholders:

> I think you've misunderstood. User needs aren't what people have told you they want. Rather, they are needs based on observed behaviour.

This struck me for two reasons: 

First, it's an elegant description of user needs.

Secondly, the people on the other end of the call were senior stakeholders. This highlights the disconnect between the worlds of "business" and "design".
