Often I'll listen to pod casts on my commute. This morning I enjoyed [an interview](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2019/11/20/yanss-167-how-to-talk-to-people-about-things/) with [Misha Glouberman](https://www.mishaglouberman.com/). He's a negotiation expert and teaches a class on the subject in Toronto and around the world.
