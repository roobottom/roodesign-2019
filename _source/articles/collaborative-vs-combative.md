This morning on my regular commute I listened to  podcast called "You Are Not So Smart". The latest episode was host David McRaney's conversation with Misha Glouberman. 

Misha is a negation expert. He teaches negation to individuals and organisations across the world. I found what he said about human interaction interesting. Not least as it has parallels with product and service design.

Whenever I imagine negotiations, I conjure an image of a high powered boardrooms. Each delegation with a clear set of goals. It's everyones purpose to win. This approach presupposes a zero-sum game. I.e., there's a fixed amount of benefit and everyone must beat their opponents to gain of much of it as possible.

This isn't what Misha means by "negotiation". He means a conversation where two or more parties work together to find mutual benefit. To start from a position of collaboration, not combat. I found this interesting as it goes against so many of our instincts. As a species, our default mode is combative. We have evolution to thank for this of course. But, combat is not a good strategy for improvement.

This highlights a fundamental difference between successful and failing businesses: Combative vs collaborative. 

Those companies who listen to their customers succeed. This is the crux of user-centred design. Listing-to and working-with customers to solve problems . It's a departure from combative companies who don't listen to their customers.
