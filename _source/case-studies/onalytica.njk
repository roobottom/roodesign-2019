  I helped Onalytica's design and product teams improve processes and kick-start a standardised approach to interface design.

Onalytica's goals were threefold:

1. To identify their most pressing usability problems;
2. to validate their current discovery and development process;
3. to help better define roles and responsibilities within the product and design team.

I spent time interviewing their users — both external clients and internal "power" users. I also conducted one-to-one sessions with designers, product managers and developers.

### Aligning teams, bottom-up
I ran an affinity mapping mapping session from which some strong themes emerged. I was then able to put together a full application review — this detailed the issues which were having the most significant impact on users.

Using this visual _laundry list_, Onalytica's teams were able to plan out fixes for specific UX problems. Moreover, presenting findings in this way further raised awareness of users and their needs.

### Aligning teams, top down
It was clear that many of the skills and processes they needed to improve the overall usability of their products were already in place. However, there wasn't a single unified vision of how teams should work together from the top.

I gave a presentation to Onalytica's management team in which I outlined a framework process and a set of clearly defined roles they needed to make this process work.
{% endset %}
{% set designCode %}
In the second phase of work I co-designed and built a front-end pattern library.

Working alongside Onalytica’s design and development teams, I created a custom build of Bootstrap. I built a pattern library interface to enable developers to pick and use components easily.

All the components compose together, so the pattern library can also be used to create a test new interface combinations quickly.
