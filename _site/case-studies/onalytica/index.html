<p>Onalytica’s goals were threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>To identify Discover’s most pressing usability problems — what we called “the low-hanging fruit”;</li>
<li>to validate their current discovery and development process;</li>
<li>to help better define roles and responsibilities within the product and design team.</li>
</ol>
<p>I spent time interviewing their users — both external clients and internal “power” users. I also conducted one-to-one sessions with designers, product managers and developers.</p>
<h2>The low hanging fruit</h2>
<p>Using the general themes which emerged from the user interviews (via an affinity mapping exercise) as pointers, I conducted a full app review — this highlighted different classes of issue that were causing problems in users’ understanding of Discover.</p>
<p>I prioritised the emerging themes so I could present these back as next-step recommendations to the whole team.</p>
<h2>Aligning teams from the top</h2>
<p>It was clear that many of the skills and processes they needed to improve the overall usability of their products were already in place. However, there wasn’t a single unified vision of how teams should work together from the top down.</p>
<p>I gave a presentation to Onalytica’s management team in which I outlined a framework process and a set of clearly defined roles they needed to make this process work.</p>
<h2>Co-designing</h2>
<p>To help embed this new process, I worked alongside Karl Roche, Onalytica’s senior UX designer to design, test and refine an updated listing page for Discover. As one of the most common page types in their application, I felt this would provide the most immediate benefit for users and provide a useful benchmark as to how to design and develop going forward.</p>
<p>We created sketches, screen designs and a click-through prototype which enabled us to test with Onalytica’s internal “power” users — making adjustments based on their feedback.</p>
<h2>Kick-starting a design revolution</h2>
<p>To address the issue of inconsistency of the interface in Discover, I built a simple <strong>pattern library</strong> based on a confined set of colours and controls from Bootstrap. Although there’s lots more work to do, this simple set of consistent controls provides a jumping-off point for great work to happen.</p>
<p>From the time I’d spent with developers, I’d discovered they were dissatisfied with the quality of the design specification they were receiving.  I helped Onalytica introduce Zeplin into their workflow to provide a detailed spec to the engineering team.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>I loved working with the team at Onlytica. They were open to suggestions and eager to learn. Most of what I helped them with, they already knew or had implemented in small pockets here-and-there. I was able to help them take this localised knowledge and align everyone around a common goal of being user-centred in their approach to product management, design and development.</p>
